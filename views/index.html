        <h3>OUR PEOPLE</h3>
        <p>
          Our people are our greatest asset and our driving force. Through rigorous hiring standards and a strong focus on culture fit, we find the best candidates in the industry. Then we provide them with the training, technology, and environments that they need to thrive. We focus on empowerment, recognition, and growth.
          <br><br>
          Employees get a full suite of benefits including competitive salaries, paid time off, investment plans, health insurance, team-building events, access to sports and fitness activities, and even nap rooms and massages. It’s no wonder our average annual attrition rate is just 15% (WAY lower than industry averages).
          <br><br>
          The result is engaged, proactive employees who are passionate about their work.

      <h3>OUR LOCATION</h3>
      <p>
        Lower cost of living means lowering operating costs, and a huge talent pool of educated and passionate people means top-notch results.
        <br><br>
        The Philippines is the third-largest English speaking country in the world. Filipinos speak English with little to no accent and have a strong understanding of Western culture -- so much so that the Philippines has been named as the global leader in quality of English and Western cultural affinity. *According to the Talent Index generated by O2P and the Everest Group.
        <br><br>
        Davao is the third-most populated city in the Philippines. With millions of qualified professionals and fewer outsourcers than other Philippine cities, there’s less saturation and more access to workforce. Solid infrastructure, skilled people, and local government support for the industry make Davao the perfect location.
